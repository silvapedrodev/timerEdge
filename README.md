## ⚠️🐞 Pending Bugs
**Timer does not account for intervals between pauses:** The timer operates based on whole seconds rather than milliseconds, which can result in incorrect timing when multiple pauses are involved. This means that if the user pauses and resumes the timer several times, the milliseconds between pauses are not accounted for correctly, potentially leading to delays in the total time calculation.

**Progress bar overlap issues:** The progress bar may appear partially behind the countdown circle, creating a visual effect of overlap or a "leak" in the edge of the circle. This can seem like a texture or design flaw.

I am open to suggestions on how to resolve these issues! If you have ideas or solutions, please feel free to reach out to me. 😊🤝 As a beginner, this project has been a significant challenge for me.
